# Geekness level interview questions

Geeks are the best software engineers, period. 

I have a lot of geek friends and over the year I've worked with lots and lots of them. Some of the best and 
worst personalities I found among geeks, I feel like this group has the bigest variance of emotional inteligence among
all other esteriotypes.

So how do you tell a great guy from a jerk? I have a set of questions I like to use on interviews. They are very 
unorthodox but I think good candidates really like it, while the bad ones start to make faces.

## 1. Pets

I think the kind of pet says a lot about someone.

 * do you have a pet?
 * which animal is that, and why you chose this one?
 
If not, ask which animal he/she would like to have as a pet. Personally, I like "cat people". Pets require a great
deal of commitment - and the best employes are the ones who are able to commit.

## 2. Superheros

 * If you could be a superhero, which one would you pick and why?
 
A real geek will talk a lot here. I like people that prefer Marvel over DC comics.
